                                                     KEY LEARNINGS FROM THIS PROJECT

1. FOCUS ON WHAT WORKS, CUT WHAT DOESN'T.
A few products/locations make most of the money. Regular fat items and top 5 categories drive 70%+ revenue. Stop wasting time on losers—double down on winners.

2. SMALL CITIES = BIG OPPORTUNITY.
Tier 3 cities make way more money ($472K) than big cities ($336K). Less competition, hungry customers. Lesson: Go where others aren't looking.

3. TOO MANY PRODUCTS = TOO MANY PROBLEMS
8,523 items is chaos. Most barely sell. Seafood made only $9K—why even stock it? Cut 1,000+ dead products, use that space/money for bestsellers.

4. HOW YOU SELL BEATS WHAT YOU SELL.
Supermarkets crush grocery stores ($787K vs $151K) selling similar stuff. It's not the products—it's the store vibe, layout, and shopping experience that matter.

5. BIGGER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER
Medium outlets ($508K) beat large ones ($445K). Sweet spot = not too big (expensive), not too small (limited). Medium = efficient and profitable.

6. DIG DEEPER INTO THE DATA
First pass missed fat content patterns by outlet type. One metric alone tells half the story. Always cross-check: Does Product A sell better in Location B? That's where gold hides.
