                                Revenue & Transaction Patterns
   	
1.  $1.2M milestone achieved with $141 Avg transaction.
2.  Upselling opportunity  : Moderate basket sizes with $5-15 lift potential.
  Action  : Deploy "$150 spend = $10 off" promotions, train staff on bundling.

                                Product Portfolio Optimization
1. 8,523 SKUs = complexity risk spreading inventory thin.
2. Top 20% items drive 80% revenue  (ABC analysis needed).
3. Action  : Cut bottom 500-1,000 slow movers, reinvest in top performers.

                                   Outlet Performance
1. Medium outlets dominate  : $508K (42%) vs High $445K.
2. Tier 3 locations outperform  : $472K vs Tier 1 $336K (40% gap).
3. Supermarket Type1 leads  : $788K vs Grocery Stores $152K.
4. Action  : Prioritize medium-format + Tier 3 expansion.

                                     Category & Product Mix
  1. Fruits/Vegetables underutilized   : $178K from only 81 SKUs (highest efficiency).
  2. Regular fat dominates   : 65% ($776K) vs Low fat 35% ($425K).
  3. Long-tail drain : 13 categories under $60K waste resources.
  4. Action   : Double F&V SKUs, consolidate tail categories.

                                        Growth Concerns
1. Expansion stalled post-2017   : Peak $205K (2018) → $132K (2022).
2. 4.0 rating = "good not great" (trails 4.3-4.5 leaders).
3. Action  : Close bottom 10% outlets, launch 15-20 Tier 3 stores.


                                        STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS 

                                       Immediate Actions (Q1)
1. SKU Rationalization  : Cut 500-1,000 items, double F&V selection to 160+ SKUs.
2. Basket Building       : $150 threshold promos, checkout impulse buys.
3. Tier 3 Blitz          : Open 5-7 outlets in high-performing smaller cities.

                                      Growth Levers (6-12 months)
1. Medium Format Focus : 70% of new openings in sweet-spot size.
2.  Rating Recovery     : Target 4.3+ via complaint resolution & best practice replication.
3.  Premium Push        : Test regular fat variants at 10-15% markup, premium low-fat at 15% markup.

                                          Operational Efficiency
1. ABC Analysis  : Focus on top 1,000 SKUs driving 80% revenue.
2. Seasonal Strategy  : Low-fat in Jan-Feb, regular fat during festivals.
3. Outlet Audit   : Close underperformers, convert high→medium format.

                                                  Expected Impact
1. +25% revenue growth    ($1.2M → $1.5M target).

3. +20% margin on F&V via farm partnerships.
4. +40% Tier 3 revenue from aggressive expansion.
5. 0.3-point rating boost = 4-8% repeat visit increase.

                                                     KEY LEARNINGS FROM THIS PROJECT

1. SKU complexity kills efficiency    – less is more with focused hero products.
2. Location > Format                   – Tier 3 beats Tier 1 despite lower prestige.
3. Medium outlets are goldilocks zone  – right balance of reach & efficiency.
4. Data-driven pruning unlocks growth  – cutting losers funds winners.
5. Rating gaps signal revenue leaks    – every 0.1 point = 2-4% repeat visits.
